LayoutPlannerPlus 
This is the save and load feature with htumbnail that I always wished existed when creating bar layouts. 

Al credit to Noryon the LayoutPlanner for the base that we have expanded on here.

With a little help from my digital friends, it’s finally here for your Beyond All Reasonable Pleasure.

You can now load your old LayoutPlanner files, copy them, and rename them for easier organisation and quick access.
