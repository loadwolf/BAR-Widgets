This is the save and load feature I always wished existed when creating bar layouts. With a little help from my digital friends, it’s finally here for your Beyond All Reasonable Pleasure.

To-do list

 - Add snapping options (middle of grid square and on-grid alignment)
 - Fix search
 - Get feedback and refine
